        <p><b>1. What is HTTP?</b></p>
        
        <p><i> HTTPS is short for "Hypertext Transfer Protocal". 
            it means that the connection would be encrypted between your web browswer 
            and the website. Though this does not always mean a website is secure. </i></p>
        
        <p><b>2. What is HTML?</b></p>
        <p><i> HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a coding language that is used

        <p><b>3. Describe the process of requesting a web page from a web server.</b></p>
        <p><i> Your browser goes to the DNS server, gets the IP address of the website,

        <p><b>4. What is the difference between a regular tag and an empty tag?</b></p>
